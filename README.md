This repository contains the source code for the Flash interactive graphic used in the New York Times Article ["All of Inflationâ€™s Little Parts"](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/03/business/20080403_SPENDING_GRAPHIC.html?_r=0).

The idea behind this repository is to preserve just a tiny part of the legacy Flash left on the internet before it inevitably disappears. Hopefully, at some point this small part of history will be converted to a more modern format for all to enjoy.
